                <h2>About me climbing</h2>
                <p> I have been climbing for 6 years.
                    i love doing it. 
                    The last 2 years I have been taking it more seriously, 
                    and that has helped me improve a lot. 
                    I have always just been bouldering. 
                    Recently I also started trying lead climbing however that hasnt evovled much yet.
                    Before I started climbing I did a lot of gymnastics,
                    while i did stop doing that a while ago it has a lot of impact on my climbing.
                    For example you get to know how to use your body very well in
                    gymnastics and that helps you navigate on the. 
                    Being flexible helps a lot aswell.

                <h2>Training and Competions</h2>
                <p> I have been doing training the entire time I have been 
                    climbing (6 years). Beside training I climb 2 more times
                    a week (total 4 times). Since this year I have aslo been 
                    participate in 'offical' competitions. Before i just did tons 
                    of local competions, but those were mostly for fun.

                <h2>Outside Climbing</h2>
                <p> Last year i went outside climbing for 
                    the first time. Outside climbing is quite different.
                    You need your own crashpad (like a cushon/pad to land on).
                    Luckily i have one. 
                    You can't go climbing where i live so we drive to
                    Fountaine Bleau in France. It is located an hour under
                    Paris and it is probably the most well know bouldering
                    place in Europe. 
                    This year (2023) I have already been twice and might go again, 
                    we'll see.

                <h2>Climbing gym</h2>
                <p> My local climbing gym is <a href="https://monk.nl/amsterdam/" target="_blank">monk</a>.
                    I have been climbing here the entire time i have been climbing. 
                    It is an amazing gym, the staff is very sweet.
                    The people who climb there are always delightfull. 
                    Almost every time I am there it is amazing. 
                    They have 2 locations in Amsterdam. One in the North and one in the east.
                    Beside the ones in Amsterdam you also have one in Rotterdam, 
                    Eindhoven, Hilversum and Hasselt. I dont go to these that often tho.
