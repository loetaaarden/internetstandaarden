                <h3>Bouldering</h3>
                <p>Bouldering is a form of free climbing that is
                performed on small rock formations or artificial 
                rock walls without the use of ropes or harnesses.
                While bouldering can be done without any equipment,
                most climbers use climbing shoes to help secure footholds, 
                chalk to keep their hands dry and to provide a firmer grip, 
                and bouldering mats to prevent injuries from falls. 
                Unlike free solo climbing, which is also performed without ropes, 
                bouldering problems (the sequence of moves that a climber performs 
                to complete the climb) are usually less than six metres (20 ft) tall. 
                Traverses, which are a form of boulder problem, 
                require the climber to climb horizontally from one end to another.
                Artificial climbing walls allow boulderers to climb indoors 
                in areas without natural boulders. 
                In addition, bouldering competitions take place in both 
                indoor and outdoor settings.</p>

        <section class="climbing-lead">

            <div>
                <h3>Lead climbing</h3>
                <p>Lead climbing (or leading) is a technique in 
                rock climbing where the lead climber clips their 
                rope to the climbing protection as they ascend the 
                climbing route, while their second (or belayer) remains
                at the base of the route belaying the rope to protect
                the lead climber in the event that they fall. 
                The term is used to distinguish between the two roles, 
                and the greater effort and increased risk, of the role 
                of the lead climber.
                Leading a climb is considered to be the opposite of 
                top roping a climb, where even though there is still 
                a second belaying the rope, the lead climber faces 
                little or no risk in the event of a fall and does not 
                need to clip into any protection as the rope is already 
                anchored to the top of the route (i.e. if they fall off, 
                they just hang from the rope).
                Lead climbing can be performed as free climbing 
                in a traditional climbing or a sport climbing format â€” 
                leading a traditional climb is a much riskier and 
                physically demanding exercise for the climber. 
                Competition lead climbing is a sport climbing 
                format that is part of the Olympic sport of competition 
                climbing. Lead climbing can also be performed as aid 
                climbing. The term is not generally applied to free solo 
                climbing, as the free solo climber is already alone and 
                thus there is no need to distinguish the role of leader 
                from the second.</p>

                <h3>Speed climbing</h3>
                <p>Speed climbing is a climbing discipline 
                in which speed is the ultimate goal.
                Speed climbing is done on rocks, walls and poles 
                and is only recommended for highly skilled and 
                experienced climbers.
                Competition speed climbing, 
                which takes place on an artificial and standardized 
                climbing wall, is the main form of speed climbing. 
                However, there are types of speed climbing that take 
                place outdoors, such as climbing famous big wall 
                climbing routes in the shortest times, notable examples 
                being on El Capitan in Yosemite National Park.</p>
