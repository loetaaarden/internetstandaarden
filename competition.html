                    <p>The International Federation of Sport Climbing (IFSC)
                        employs an indoor format (although competitions can also 
                        take place in an outdoor setting) that breaks the competition 
                        into three rounds: qualifications, semi-finals, and finals. 
                        The rounds feature different sets of four to six boulder 
                        problems, and each competitor has a fixed amount of time to 
                        attempt each problem. At the end of each round, competitors 
                        are ranked by the number of completed problems with ties 
                        settled by the total number of attempts taken to solve the 
                        problems.
                        Some competitions only permit climbers a fixed number of 
                        attempts at each problem with a timed rest period in 
                        between.[30] In an open-format competition, all climbers 
                        compete simultaneously, and are given a fixed amount of 
                        time to complete as many problems as possible. 
                        More points are awarded for more difficult problems, 
                        while points are deducted for multiple attempts on the 
                        same problem.

                    <p>
                        The development of the safer format of sport 
                        climbing in the early 1980s led to rapid development 
                        in the sport of competition lead climbing. 
                        The first major international lead climbing 
                        competition was held in Italy at Sportroccia in 1985. 
                        By the late 1990s, competitive lead climbing was joined 
                        by competition bouldering, and competition speed 
                        climbing in what was to become the annual IFSC 
                        Climbing World Cup and biennial IFSC Climbing 
                        World Championships.

                <h4>Speed climbing</h4>
                    
                <div>
                    <img src="images/climbing_11.jpg" alt="Speed Climbing">
                    <p>Competition speed climbing as governed by the 
                        International Federation of Sport Climbing (IFSC) 
                        takes place on 15-metre (49 ft) artificial walls. 
                        Competitors climb a 5-degree overhanging IFSC-certified 
                        wall, with an auto-belaying system from the top of the 
                        wall.
                        Since 2007 the IFSC has created a standard wall for the 
                        world record. The standard has a simple rule and it 
                        involves climbers competing on the same route, 
                        side by side, and whoever reaches the top first wins.
                        The holds and order are always identical, and the 
                        difficulty rating is around F6b (approximately YDS 5.10c), 
                        which is a level most recreational climbers could complete. 
                        The IFSC also sanctions speed climbing competitions 
                        and those events that entail world record attempts.

                    <p>In August 2016, the IOC announced that competition 
                        climbing would be a sport in the 2020 Summer Olympics, 
                        but that lead, boulder, and speed would be combined into
                        a single medal event; this caused upset however it 
                        allowed the maximum number of disciplines to feature 
                        at the Olympics. During August 3–6, 2021, 
                        Alberto Ginés López and Janja Garnbret won the first-ever 
                        men's and women's Olympic climbing gold medals at the Tokyo 
                        Olympics, in the newly created combined event consisting of 
                        all three disciplines.
                        After the Tokyo Olympics, it was announced that the 
                        2024 Paris Olympics would only combine lead climbing 
                        and bouldering into a single medal event, with speed 
                        climbing split out into a standalone medal event.
